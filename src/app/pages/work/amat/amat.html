        <h4>❉Post-Acquisition Supply Chain Integration & Optimization - Picosun Oy</h4>
        <p>As the lead for the Picosun (PCS) integration project, I ensured alignment with AMAT main product strategy and mainframe (MF) requirements.
            this role required closing a critical logistics and data gap; specifically, I developed the immediate critical bulk parts logistics route 
            and defined the missing steps needed to successfully load parts information into SAP. 
            By addressing Picosun relative lack of standardized specification data (typical of a start-up), I accelerated integration and drove siginificant supply chain efficiency.
